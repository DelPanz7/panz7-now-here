  "bio": "I am Ziqi (pronounced as Zee-Chee?). 我是潘紫琪，潘紫琪的紫，潘紫琪的琪。<br><br>I am a PhD year 3 student in the Computer Science and Engineering department at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by Prof. Xiaojuan Ma. Previously, I obtained my undergraduate degree of Computer Science and Technology from Tsinghua University.<br><br>As I write in my slogan, I care about people. Therefore, my research is driven by the question of <b style='color:#c5a059'><i>how additional technological support can empower the interactions people already have with the world as complementaries</i></b>, rather than replace them. So far, my work has examined <b style='color:#c5a059'><i>human–environment</i></b> and <b style='color:#c5a059'><i>human–human</i></b> interaction; next, I hope to deepen my focus on <b style='color:#c5a059'><i>human–self</i></b> interaction, particularly through embodied and physical interfaces such as robots and interactive objects.<br><br>Apart from research, I am also a huge fan of music, dance and kpop. I make acapella music and dance covers. FYI, my kpop bias is GOT7, DAY6, and Xdinary Heroes. I also learnt to tell fortune with tarot cards, you can catch up with me for a tarot reading session if you are interested!",
