        "story": "我总说，总会因为拿起麦克风而心动，无论是主持还是唱歌。<br><br>I always say that I can’t help falling in love the moment I pick up a microphone, whether I’m hosting or singing.<br><br>其实我不算是一个有唱歌天赋的人。小时候因为特别自信所以报名了一个很有名气的合唱团，然而，去到合唱团的第一次入团测试，老师就跟我说，‘‘要么你再练一周，要么你就别来了’’。我的父母对我，比我对我自己还要自信，听到这样的话自然不开心，二话没说就打算劝我，别唱了。而向来对父母言听计从的乖乖小孩，我，却第一次做出了和爸妈相悖的选择，‘‘帮我找个学音乐的大学生吧，我想再试试’’。<br><br>Strictly speaking, I’m not someone with a natural gift for singing. When I was little, I was very confident and signed up for a well‑known choir. But at the very first audition, the teacher told me, “Either practice for another week, or don’t come back.” My parents had even more faith in me than I had in myself, so they were understandably upset to hear that, and immediately tried to persuade me to quit singing. I had always been the obedient child who did whatever my parents said, but for the first time I made a choice that went against them: “Please help me find a college student who studies music. I want to give it another try.”<br><br>那次的坚持或许出于自尊或者倔强，但它的结果，是让我爱上了唱歌，尤其是合唱。我喜欢和声的原因，正是因为就算像我这样没什么声乐天赋小孩，也能因为练习努力音准准确而成为和声中很重要的人；就算像我这样没有什么声音特色的小孩，也能因为没有什么特色而能够创造出最和谐的声音。在和声里，我感受到了世界里很难触及的对不完美的包容，感受到了不完美的自己也很重要。<br><br>Maybe that persistence came from pride or stubbornness, but the result was that I fell in love with singing, especially choral music. The reason I love harmony is that even a kid like me, without much vocal talent, can become an important part of the sound by working hard and singing in tune; and even a kid like me, whose voice has no particular “character,” can precisely because of that blend in and help create the most harmonious sound. In harmony, I felt a rare kind of acceptance of imperfection, and I felt that my imperfect self could also matter.<br><br>后来，我开始接触到比起传统合唱更有可塑性也更具难度的纯人声无伴奏合唱（Acapella），并且很彻底地爱上了她。在阿卡的世界里，比起合唱，我又发现了自己更多的可能性，我可以去模仿乐器，可以去尝试改变声线。如果说合唱教会了我，普普通通也可以是一种竞争力，那么阿卡贝拉则告诉了我，没有特色的声音可以通过努力和雕琢变得具有更强的可塑性，正如璞玉比起美玉更有打磨的价值。<br><br>Later on, I was introduced to a form that is even more flexible and challenging than traditional choir: pure a cappella, and I fell head over heels in love with it. In the world of a cappella, compared with choir, I discovered even more possibilities for myself: I could imitate instruments, and I could experiment with changing my vocal tone. If choir taught me that being ordinary can itself be a kind of strength, then a cappella taught me that a voice without distinctive features can, through hard work and refinement, become highly malleable—like how an unpolished stone has more room to be carved than a finished gem.<br><br>我的喜爱很幸运地与我拥有的机遇重合了，无论是在清华、牛津还是港科，我都遇到了愿意让我成为一员的阿卡团，Maj9、OXCAR、Tunatics。他们成为我失落时的温柔乡，孤独时回声，以及找不到自己的意义时认可我的奖章。我在一次次演出和排练中，我从大家需要带着我练的小孩，变成可以办成一场演出的成员，而今又成长为可以被年轻朋友们依靠的music director。如今，可能已经有超过一万个人听过我的歌声了，我在礼堂、街头、体育馆、音乐厅的舞台上热烈地活着，第无数次为阿卡贝拉心动。谢谢大家和我一起唱歌，谢谢大家听我们唱歌，还要继续做很多舞台，编很多曲，唱很多歌。<br><br>I’ve been lucky that my passion has overlapped with the opportunities I’ve had. At Tsinghua, Oxford, and HKUST, I’ve all found a cappella groups willing to take me in: Maj9, OXCAR, Tunatics. They became my haven when I was frustrated, my echo when I was lonely, and my medal of recognition when I couldn’t find meaning in myself. Through round after round of rehearsals and performances, I went from being the kid everyone had to guide along, to a member who could help put on a full show, and now to a music director whom younger friends can rely on. By now, maybe more than ten thousand people have heard me sing. On stages in auditoriums, on the street, in sports arenas, and in concert halls, I’ve been living fiercely and vividly, falling in love with a cappella for the countless time. Thank you for singing with me, thank you for listening to us sing. I still want to stand on many more stages, arrange many more songs, and sing many, many more.",
